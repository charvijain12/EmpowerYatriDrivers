## Problem Statement 3: Skill Development 💡
### The Challenge 🌟
The Namma Yatri Open Mobility Challenge aims to foster innovative solutions for solving mobility issues. In the March 2023 edition, 10 challenges span across 3 tracks: Future of Mobility, Driver Enablement, and Namma Yatri. Problem Statement 3 focuses on Driver Enablement, seeking ways to digitally empower drivers to earn on par with their peers.

### The Problem 🛣️
Drivers of various ages often face technological barriers, impacting their adoption of apps and features. The challenge encompasses:

- Driver's resistance to change.
- Language barriers.
- Unviable business models.
- Unengaging content/training.
- Lack of accountability and monitoring systems.

## The Goal 🎯
The goal is to innovatively enable drivers digitally, making them tech-savvy. Solutions should focus on user-friendly content/training accessible to drivers of all ages/backgrounds, address language barriers, devise viable business models, and ensure accountability for earning parity among drivers.

## Solution 💡
The proposed solution involves developing a user-friendly app to aid non-tech-savvy drivers. Features include language support, engaging content, and monitoring systems for effective learning and earning.
